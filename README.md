# Student Management System (Python + Tkinter + PostgreSQL)

This is a simple desktop application that lets you manage student data using a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter. The app connects to a PostgreSQL database and allows users to create a table, add new students, update existing records, delete students, and view all data using a Treeview table.

## Features

- Add new student records
- Edit and update selected student records
